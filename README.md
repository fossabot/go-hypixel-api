Hypixel API SDK in Golang

---

## Simple and Fast
- The go-hypixel-api is designed to be as minimal and efficient as possible for rapid development. All Hypixel API endpoints are built-in and wrapped as functions.

## Minimal Footprint
- From the beginning, go-hypixel-api was designed to minimize package size and dependencies while still being fully featured.

## API Rate Limit Support
- It automatically handles blocking and calculates the remaining request quota based on Hypixel API response headers‚Äîno manual setup required.

## Flexibility
- We aim to provide developers with greater flexibility. Nearly all settings in go-hypixel-api can be customized, and low-level functions are exposed.

## Cache Strategy Support
- Although go-hypixel-api doesn't include a built-in caching module, it offers a comprehensive Hook and Callback mechanism, allowing developers to implement their own caching strategies.

## Rapid Adaptation
- We aim to keep up with changes in the Hypixel API quickly. Thanks to its flexible core design, developers can also adapt easily when project updates lag behind.
